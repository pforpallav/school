#CPSC313 - Memory

##Static Ram
- Expensive but fast
- Retains value as long as power is present (ala 'static')

##Dynamic Ram
- Slower
- Values must be refreshed periodically (ala 'dynamic')
- Much more power efficient

##Rules of Thumb
- Bigger means slower
- On chip -> Faster
- Off chip -> Slower, but much bigger
